# connect4
Program where a player can play connect 4 with a computer. 
The computer uses the minimax algorithm with alpha beta pruning to play with perfect strategy, and outputs some information about the results of each move as it considers them.
This is still a work in progress, as the implementation is not at all fast enough to be used from the beginning of the game, and can only be used in later stages of the game.
